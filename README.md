### Exploring Fashion MNIST dataset (Keras) using neural networks
<br>
Neural Networks are an artificial imitation of the human brain and its neural networks for various purposes, most of which include prediction abilities and detection.
<br>
The above ipynb file explores the fashion MNIST dataset from keras by representing any individual image's pixels in arrays. 
After converting it to B&W from RGB and scaling the data, we use epochs in tensorflow to train the model in accordance to various labels (shoe, purse, etc).
